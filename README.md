# Diabetes-Prediction 
Diabetes Prediction in Machine Learning using Python

Developed a machine learning model for diabetes prediction using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle, employing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data preprocessing and visualization.
Implemented standard scaling and label encoding techniques for feature engineering, and utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier from scikit-learn to predict diabetes occurrence with an accuracy of 80%.
Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix and classification report metrics, demonstrating strong analytical skills and proficiency in interpreting machine learning results for actionableÂ insights.
